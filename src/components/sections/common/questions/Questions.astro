    question: 'Are there payment plans available?',
    answer: `Yes, you can select a monthly payment plan of $550.00 a month for 10 months and $1,400.00 upfront.
        Note: You will be required to pay the full duration of the payment plan even if you finish the program before the payment plan ends.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there payment plans available?',
    answer: `Learners progress through the material at their own pace, moving on in the program by demonstrating competency in each sprint.
        With Cyram’s self-paced format, learners complete the program anywhere between 6 and 10 months.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does Cyram cost?',
    answer: `Total costs range from $11,950 for upfront tuition to $16,000+ for Deferred Tuition. With Deferred tuition, we don’t require any upfront payments.
        With both options, you’ll owe nothing if you don’t get a job within a year of graduation (terms apply).
